## Web Applications

*A collection of web-based tools and dashboards for calculating or simulating warfarin dosage.*

- [Vue-Quick-Warfarin-V2](https://github.com/Napatchouli/Vue-Quick-Warfarin-V2) - A Warfarin Web App built with Vue.js to help clinicians calculate and plan warfarin dosing. It generates daily pill schedules from a weekly target and calculates the total pills needed for an appointment period. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/Napatchouli/Vue-Quick-Warfarin-V2)
- [Warfarin Dose Calculator](https://github.com/Paond55/warfarin-calculator) - A guideline-based web tool for clinicians to calculate warfarin dose adjustments based on INR and bleeding symptoms. It suggests new weekly doses and generates multiple daily pill regimens. Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline use. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/Paond55/warfarin-calculator)
- [Warfarin Planner](https://github.com/warfarin-net/warfarin-planner) - A web tool for clinicians to translate a weekly warfarin dose into practical, daily pill schedules with multiple smart suggestions. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/warfarin-net/warfarin-planner)

## Machine Learning & Research

*Projects focused on using machine learning, data analysis, and statistical modeling to predict optimal warfarin dosage.*

- [personalized-warfarin](https://github.com/cybergeist0/personalized-warfarin) - A complete machine learning project in a Jupyter Notebook that predicts personalized warfarin doses using both clinical and genetic data (VKORC1, CYP2C9) from the PharmGKB dataset. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/cybergeist0/personalized-warfarin)
- [Warfit-Learn](https://github.com/gianlucatruda/warfit-learn) - A machine learning project using Python and scikit-learn to predict warfarin dosage. Includes a Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, model training, and evaluation. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/gianlucatruda/warfit-learn)
- [warfarin-machinelearning](https://github.com/karneslab/warfarin-machinelearning) - A Python project comparing several machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVR) to predict stable warfarin doses from clinical and pharmacogenomic data. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/karneslab/warfarin-machinelearning)
- [warfarin_dose_prediction](https://github.com/farahyusri12/warfarin_dose_prediction) - A well-documented project in a Google Colab notebook that builds a linear regression model to predict warfarin dose from the IWPC's clinical and genetic dataset. Includes detailed steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation and a final PDF report. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/farahyusri12/warfarin_dose_prediction)
