- [warfarin-calculator](https://github.com/Paond55/warfarin-calculator) - A guideline-based web tool for clinicians to calculate warfarin dose adjustments based on INR and bleeding symptoms. It suggests new weekly doses and generates multiple daily pill regimens. Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline use. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/Paond55/warfarin-calculator)
- [Warfarin-Dose-Calculator](https://github.com/prajwal-17/warfarin-dose-calculator) - React + TypeScript app for anticoagulant dosing, supporting Warfarin (initiation & INR-based maintenance) and Acitrom. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/prajwal-17/warfarin-dose-calculator)
- [Warfarin-Dosage-Calculator](https://github.com/pzweuj/warfarin-dosage-calculator) - A modern Next.js web application that implements multiple established pharmacogenomic algorithms (IWPC, Gage, Xiangya, Biss, Clover) for predicting initial warfarin dosage. Features a clean UI and multi-language support for comparison and educational purposes. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/pzweuj/warfarin-dosage-calculator)
- [warfarin-planner](https://github.com/warfarin-net/warfarin-planner) - A sophisticated web tool for translating a target weekly warfarin dose into multiple, practical daily pill regimens. Features intelligent sorting to prioritize the simplest schedules (e.g., minimizing half-pills and pill types) and can calculate total pills needed for dispensing. Built as a PWA for offline use. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/warfarin-net/warfarin-planner)

## Mobile Applications

*Open-source mobile apps for warfarin management.*

- [warfarin-management-app](https://github.com/amanjito/warfarin-management-app) - A comprehensive mobile app for patients to manage their warfarin therapy, featuring PT/INR tracking with charts, medication reminders via push notifications, and an AI-powered assistant. Built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase, and packaged for mobile using Capacitor. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/amanjito/warfarin-management-app)

## Desktop Applications

*Installable software for desktop operating systems like Windows, macOS, or Linux.*

- [INRTracker](https://github.com/starcalibre/inrtracker) - A native Windows desktop application for logging historical INR values and warfarin doses. It functions as a digital diary, storing data locally in an SQLite database. Built with C# and the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) framework. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/starcalibre/inrtracker)

## Machine Learning & Research

*Projects focused on using machine learning, data analysis, and statistical modeling to predict optimal warfarin dosage.*

- [personalized-warfarin](https://github.com/cybergeist0/personalized-warfarin) - A complete machine learning project in a Jupyter Notebook that predicts personalized warfarin doses using both clinical and genetic data (VKORC1, CYP2C9) from the PharmGKB dataset. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/cybergeist0/personalized-warfarin)
- [pgx-warfarin-ml-portfolio](https://github.com/Uche-Stephen/pgx-warfarin-ml-portfolio) - A machine learning pipeline using scikit-learn for personalized warfarin dosing prediction using clinical and genetic data (VKORC1, CYP2C9). Includes preprocessing, model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), explainability (SHAP, Permutation Importance), and a Streamlit web app. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/Uche-Stephen/pgx-warfarin-ml-portfolio)
- [warfit-learn](https://github.com/gianlucatruda/warfit-learn) - A machine learning project using Python and scikit-learn to predict warfarin dosage. Includes a Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, model training, and evaluation. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/gianlucatruda/warfit-learn)
- [warfarin-machinelearning](https://github.com/karneslab/warfarin-machinelearning) - A Python project comparing several machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVR) to predict stable warfarin doses from clinical and pharmacogenomic data. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/karneslab/warfarin-machinelearning)
- [Warfarin_Dose_Prediction](https://github.com/farahyusri12/warfarin_dose_prediction) - A well-documented project in a Google Colab notebook that builds a linear regression model to predict warfarin dose from the IWPC's clinical and genetic dataset. Includes detailed steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation and a final PDF report. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/farahyusri12/warfarin_dose_prediction)
- [warfarin-dosing-ml-tool-](https://github.com/ifthekarhussain/warfarin-dosing-ml-tool-) - An end-to-end machine learning pipeline in a Jupyter Notebook for predicting warfarin dosage using the IWPC dataset. The project covers the full workflow from data preprocessing and feature engineering to training and comparing multiple models (including regression and classification). It culminates in an interactive prediction tool built with Gradio. ![Language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/ifthekarhussain/warfarin-dosing-ml-tool-)
